# Presence-Explorer
Th√©o Arrouye - Senior Project 2017 ~ Unity VR Project

## Presence: 
  - Definition: Feeling physically present in a non-physical world
  - For my study, I attempted to measure this by having participants fill out surveys, as well as observing their physical reactions to virtual occurences

## Goals:
1) Replicate natural physics interactions

  - ex: Tossing balls around
  
2) Develop more natural movement mechanic

  - ex: Teleporting (commonly used in VR apps) is presence-breaking
  
  - solution: Movement is triggered by holding the Vive Wand's Grip button and moving your arms in a walking motion. You move in the direction that you are looking. Because this somewhat replicates natural walking/running motions, it feels more natural than teleportation. 
  
3) Explore effects of breaks in presence

  - ex: The car scene, where the cars are clearly fake and you can be 'run over' without feeling anything
